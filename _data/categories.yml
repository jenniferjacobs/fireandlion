    **Corporate communication doesn't have to be dry.** An organisation's publications can draw the reader in like the best books in a bookstore. We've worked with dozens of clients to create publications we aren't just proud of, but actually return to again and again, because reading them is just lovely.

    **At Fire and Lion** we believe that every book has a mission: that is, every story has the power and responsibility to change the world. That mission is clearest when we work with social-impact projects and organisations, like MyConstitution, Book Dash, Worldreader, Bettercare, and the More Books Campaign.
